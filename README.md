# File manager

## !!!Attention!!!

- When using commands with 2 paths and these paths contain spaces, please, enclose BOTH paths into double quotes(""). If paths don't contain spaces - write them whatever you like;
- For compressing and decompressing in destination part, please, provide file name, so command should look like this: `compress C:\folder\txt.txt` `D:\folder\archive.zip`
